The goal here is to allow for an automated verification process.

I think that the main controller will provide the LLBC from CHARON initially +
at the end of the refactoring process. This is because we need the whole crate
to produce the LLBC, and also the whole crate to do the refactoring.

From there this verfication crate will take in the two LLBC files. It will then
convert them to CoQ / F# / LEAN / whichever works. This will be used to perform
the verification.

To start with on this I need:
- A CLI that I can interface with using the two LLBC files
- And also provide options to what verification I want to run
- Fuzzing
- Program analysis
- ETC

The first stage of the CLI is to take the the path to the two .LLBC files, and
create us two coq (.v) files. The Primitives.v file needs to be pasted into the
same directory as the .v files.

Separately:
- Update rem-cli to produce the LLBC at the start and end
- Have a pipeline in rem-cli to take Path to the crate:
    - Create the LLBC
    - Run REM-extract
    - Create the New LLBC
    - Pass both LLBCs to REM-verfication
    - Go from there!
